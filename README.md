# What's Cookin?

#### Pair Project from Mon 7/6/2020 - Wed 7/15/2020 in Module 2 at Turing School of Software and Design

## About

- This is a recipe tracking / meal planning application that allows users to browse recipes and plan their shopping trips around them. The user can add recipes to their 'Favorite Recipes' and/or 'Recipes to Cook' page as they browse and then view those pages later. In addition, the user can search the recipes by tag (i.e. side dish).  The recipe cards also show the total cost of the recipe and if the user has enough ingredients to cook it.
